ðŸ’‹ INTRODUCTION-

Hello, my fellow coders and viewers. The time has come after months of studies and practice to present to you my fourth web application 'BLAH'. I'm excited to showcase the new skills and knowledge that I have adapted from Ruby on Rails to create and Object Oriented Programming application with three models and one of the models representing a joins table. Learning Ruby on Rails had it's challenges with combining more than a few elements I did not have to implement with past projects. I got to work with the magic of serializers, validations, exceptions and many more elements that work with the front end in order to have a solid application that involved a joins table. After a few weeks of dedication to this project, I'm happy to announce I'm walking away from phase 4 confident that I've gained a tremendous amount of knowledge to build even more complexed future projects.


ðŸ’‹ What is the inspiration behind BLAH?

When I thought about working with a joins table the first thing that came to mind was Instagram. As a user, I know on Instagram I can see post from others users and leave any comments I desire on these post (depending if I'm authorized or I meet validation credentials). In todays society a lot of us are obsessed with the world of celebrities and thier daily lives. When I thought of Instagram, I thought about one of my favortie accounts I follow, E News. An account all about celebrities and their daily lives. Users are able to leave comments on E News posts made about celebrities. This means a user has many comments and posts through comments, a post has many comments and many users through comments, and a comment belongs to a user and a post. With this algorithim in place I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could replicate what a user sees and can do on Instagram. Voila! BLAH was born.


ðŸ’‹ The ideas behind the application.

 I wanted to create an application that was clean and simple. When you visit our web application our goal is to make sure the user doesn't question what to do and how to do it. I know as a user of many platforms myself, if the application is'nt easy for me to navigate through, there's a high chance I won't return. Visually I believe it is important to make your application pop. I wanted to add some popular effects on this application to keep it fresh and fun. From adding hovered titles over images and hovered shadow navigation throughout the client side routing navigation bar. Little details go along way to keep users interested. I believe it's not only the content given that keeps interest but also the design given to the user throughout the application.
